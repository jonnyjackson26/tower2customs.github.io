You are a diamond youre 24 carrot
You taste the rainbow as if youre a parrot
You is my main bro, my homie, my jarret
You may be skittish but dont be embaresed
You are a real one, i love you i swear it. 
Me and ur friends we have u all cherished
Thats what she said sweatshirt but i aint never gon wear it
I keep it as a memory itll be my inheritance
Wow

Jarret i swear youre the fairest
But you dont need a mirror to compare it
Just Take it from me,
Youre the best one from the 10283 
You know what i mean
Who else gets that referenfe? Nobody just you and me


Jarret youre a record breaker 
And the star player 
I wrote this beat im a record maker
Kinda like bruno mars, does this make you think of the gift u gave her? 
Yeah jessys my sister dont ever forsake her

Youre a number 1 fortnite player
They put you in the leauges and you'd go major
They put u in a town and youd go mayor
They put u in LA and youd go a Laker
You lebron and kobe, there aint nobody greater
You could do it whenever: now or later
But u dont like that bc skittles are your favorite flavor
Rhymes leaking out of me like a salt shaker



Dont feed him grapes he gets salty like a pretzel
Dont go up against him, hed beat u in a wrestle

Jarret youre right everywhere like a perfect square
Others beware
Tbh im kinda jealous of you its just not fair
Future millionaire 
Your feelings as soft as a hare
No wonder they call u jare-bear



I hope youre dad gets better soon
And id write this song for you 
Even if it were the last thing i ever do

Feel free to play this again and sing along,
Itll prolly be in ur head all day long
The title is the jarret apprecaction song
